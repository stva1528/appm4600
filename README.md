This file contains all of my course work for APPM4600 (Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing) taken during the fall semester of my senior year at CU Boulder. The structure of the subdirectory includes a file for homework and a file for labs. Each of those files has additional files for the specific homework assignment or weekly lab.
